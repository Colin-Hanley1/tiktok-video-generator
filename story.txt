My husband’s been dealing with some kind of stomach bug the last few days—
vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, the works.

I’ve been taking care of him, the house, and our two toddlers—both under five—
which, as you can imagine, is a lot.

This morning, he said he was feeling a bit better and wanted to try eating.
So I made him toast, as requested.

He’s in the living room, nibbling away,
while I’m busy in the kitchen making breakfast for the kids and feeding them.

Suddenly, I hear violent gagging from the other room.

Now—he’s had a trash can next to the couch this entire time for exactly this reason.
So I yell out,
“Hey, use the trash can or go to the bathroom if you’re gonna puke!”

But he doesn’t.

He throws up all over the floor.
Some of it even gets on the couch.

He then walks into the kitchen—
where I’m still in the middle of feeding our toddlers—
and says,
“I’m gonna lie down in our room so you can clean up my puke.”

I said,
“Absolutely not.”

I told him,
“There was no reason to vomit on the floor.
You had plenty of warning,
you had time,
you had a trash can—
and I’ve already been cleaning up your surprise messes all weekend without complaint.”

I told him this one’s on him.

Now he’s mad at me
for not showing what he calls “good bedside manner.”
